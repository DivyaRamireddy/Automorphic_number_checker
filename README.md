# 🔍 Automorphic Number Checker (Placement Important)

An **Automorphic Number** is a number whose **square ends with the same digits as the number itself**.

Example:  
25 → 25² = 625 → ends with **25** ✔️  

This program is commonly asked in interviews because it tests:
- Square calculation  
- String ending check  
- Basic mathematical logic

## 🔹 Features
- Checks if a number is Automorphic
- Simple and clean logic using `.endswith()`
- Placement-oriented program

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used
- Squaring numbers
- String operations
- Functions & condition checks

---

## 🚀 How to Run
```bash
python automorphic_number_checker.py# Automorphic_number_checker
